# 💧 Water Quality Monitoring (WQM)

A **Complaint Management System** designed to streamline the process of handling citizen grievances for city administration. Through a user-friendly web application, citizens can submit complaints regarding **water leakage, contamination, and quality issues**, while administrators can efficiently track, manage, and resolve them.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Current complaint mechanisms for water-related issues are often fragmented, inefficient, and lack transparency. This project provides a **centralized digital solution** for managing citizen complaints related to water quality

## 🎯 Objectives

* Develop a **platform** for reporting water quality complaints.
* Implement an **administration system** to manage and visualize submissions.
* Enhance **citizen engagement** and improve response times.

## 🌍 SDG 6 Alignment

This project supports **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6): Clean Water and Sanitation**.

* **Goal 6:** Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
* **Target 6.1:** Achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030.
* **Indicator 6.1.1:** Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services.

## 🧩 System Thinking

To tackle water quality issues holistically, we applied **systems thinking** by breaking down the problem into smaller, interdependent components.
